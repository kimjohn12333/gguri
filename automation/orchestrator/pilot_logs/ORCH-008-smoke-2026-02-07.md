# ORCH-008 Smoke Execution Log

Path: `automation/orchestrator/pilot_logs/ORCH-008-smoke-2026-02-07.md`
Date (KST): 2026-02-07
Mode: Team Mode pilot (MVP)

## Sample Task Definition
- Task ID: `ORCH-008-SMOKE-1`
- Goal: produce pilot runbook + one smoke log + README pointer update.
- Output paths:
  - `automation/orchestrator/PILOT_RUNBOOK.md`
  - `automation/orchestrator/pilot_logs/ORCH-008-smoke-2026-02-07.md`
  - `automation/orchestrator/README.md`
- Acceptance:
  - runbook includes objective/scope, prerequisites, procedure, failure checkpoints, rollback
  - smoke log includes task/timeline/result/lessons
  - README links runbook + pilot log path

## Execution Timeline (short)
- 22:36: ORCH-008 picked (`IN_PROGRESS`) from queue.
- 22:37-22:41: Reviewed `TOKEN_POLICY.md`, `README.md`, `QUEUE.md`, `orch.py`.
- 22:41-22:45: Authored `PILOT_RUNBOOK.md` (MVP flow + checkpoints).
- 22:45-22:47: Authored smoke log file and updated `README.md` link section.
- 22:47-22:49: Validated file presence/structure and prepared queue done update.

## Result Summary
- Status: PASS
- Artifacts created/updated:
  - `automation/orchestrator/PILOT_RUNBOOK.md` (new)
  - `automation/orchestrator/pilot_logs/ORCH-008-smoke-2026-02-07.md` (new)
  - `automation/orchestrator/README.md` (updated with pilot references)
- Queue handling: ORCH-008 marked `DONE` with concise notes via `orch.py done`.

## Lessons Learned (3)
1. Path-first acceptance criteria reduces back-and-forth and token waste.
2. For MVP pilot, one strict report format (Compact Report) is enough to enforce quality.
3. Queue terminal updates should be scripted (`orch.py done/fail`) to avoid table-edit mistakes.
